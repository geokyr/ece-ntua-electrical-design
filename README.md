Semester Project and Lab Assignments for the [Electrical Design](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3035) course, during the 7th semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Project Description

The semester project involved the design of both a Mechanical Drawing and an Electrical Drawing for a typical apartment.

The Mechanical Drawing task required to draw the front view, the plan view and the side view as well as a cross-section in an appropriate vertical plane either on the front or side elevation.

The Electrical Drawing task focused on designing the low-voltage electrical installation for a multi-room apartment, considering regulations and standards, calculating voltage drop, and specifying cable types and conduit diameters. The electrical supply is assumed to be three-phase at 230/400V, 50Hz with TN grounding.

## Lab Assignments

There were 3 lab assignments in total, aimed to provide the fundamentals of electrical design. They covered tasks such as creating floor plans, placing electrical loads, and designing an electrical installation for an apartment, ultimately providing hands-on experience in the field of electrical engineering and design. The [ElectricalDesign](https://www.ti-soft.com/en/products/software/electricaldesign) software from TiSoft was used for the lab assignments.

## Lab 01

In the first lab, the floor plan of a typical apartment had to be designed. The apartment consisted of a living room, a kitchen, 3 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms and the plan view was provided.

## Lab 02

In the second lab, we had to place some loads in the floor plan of the apartment from the previous lab. The loads included a kitchen, a water heater, a washing machine, a dishwasher, a fridge, 3 air conditioners, 17 lights and 20 sockets. It was also required to draw 3 lines for some of the loads. One central panel board and a sub-panel board were used.

## Lab 03

In the third lab, the aim was to study and design an electrical installation. In particular, a ready-made floor plan of an appartment was given, to which specific loads were to be placed. Then, it was required to divide the loads into lines, to draw the lines, to assign the lines to circuits so that the program can generate the one-line diagram.
